      The red flamingo flew up from the South, From the land all withered and
      parched with drouth.
      <br />
      He gleamed on the sky like a flaming brand Blown from a burning prairie
      land.
      <br />
      He waded deep through the dark morass, In the samphire beds, and the cool
      dank grass.
